          <p>
            Novice programmer with aspirations to get into the game design or
            web design community. I use many different programming languages in
            my work, mainly HTML5, C# and Java but have touched on PHP, SLGL, C
            and JavaScript. I enjoy photography and 3D modelling as it lets my
            imagination run free and gets me away from programming to unwind. I
            try my best to create 3D models that I can use for animation or in
            games.

            I aim to gain a further understanding of Java, HTML5 and C#. With
            technology advancing ever faster itâ€™s important to keep up to date
            with new developments and approaches to digital design. I have been
            recently looking into node.js, Vue and React these are both upcoming
            JavaScript libraries capable of creating better functionality and
            user interfaces.

            On a day to day basis I would be repairing windscreens on lorries,
            busses and cars. This job has taught me excellent attention to
            detail skills, that have helped me with my coding career by making
            simple mistakes in my code easier to notice. It has also taught me
            patience as this job can take several attempts to get right.

          <p>
            To date I have created three websites, two for myself and one for a
            client. The client wanted a responsive website created in html5 the
            purpose of the website was to showcase his company and as a medium
            for contact to the owner. There are many things I learnt from this
            process and look forward to working on more websites in the future.
